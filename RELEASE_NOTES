Initial commit of development/master branches.
Planar and spherical work for single level grids.
wdconvect and reacting bubble tests implemented.
AMR and variable spherical base state spacing are WIP.

Load balancing improvements
Spherical variable-base state implemented (still testing and debugging)
Added files to help with AMR debugging with constant base-state spherical case
Implemented correct corner coupling for 3d conservative quantity advection
Implemented dpdt term for variable-base state spherical MAC projection
