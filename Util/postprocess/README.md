# Rotating fully convective star diagnostics

Process a fully convective star problem to produce a set of diagnostic measures
including:

- Convection speed
- Ratio of mean rotation rates to surface rotation
- Meridional circulation velocities
- Br체nt-V채is채l채 frequency

## Building & running

The n-dimensional diagnostic can be built by executing `make DIM=n`. This will
produce the executable `radial_nd.exe`. Note that `DIM=3` is default setting and
the only one that is currently supported. To run, the executable must be provided
with the name of the plotfile to be analyzed:
```
./radial_3d.exe infile=plotfile_name
```

Additional arguments are as follows:

- **model file diagnostics**: extra argument `modelfile=modelfile_name` needs to be provided
- **time-averaged values**: two extra arguments need to be provided
  1. `dt=timesteps_between_plotfiles`, which is an integer value
  2. `nfiles=num_plotfiles` indicates the number of *additional* plotfiles needed, not including the `infile`.
