This documentation is a work in progress.  \maestroex\ is rapidly evolving, so portions of 
the text are likely to be incomplete or out-of-date. \\

\maestroex\ is an updated C++/Fortran implementation of the previous (pure-Fortran) 
\maestro\ code.  Thus, \maestroex\ is able to leverage the updated capability of the 
\amrex\ software  framework for massively parallel, block-structured adaptive mesh 
refinement (AMR) applications.  The \amrex\ library (and formerly, the \boxlib\ library) 
is developed at the Center for Computational Sciences and Engineering at Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory.  \amrex\ is distributed separately from \maestroex\ 
(see \url{https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex}). \\

\noindent The current version of the \maestroex\ User's Guide can be found in 
the \maestroex\ source tree under {\tt MAESTROeX/Docs/}.\\

\noindent \maestroex\ is developed at the Center for Computational Sciences and
Engineering at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and at Stony
Brook University.  Development is/was supported by the SciDAC Program of
the DOE Office of Mathematics, Information, and Computational Sciences
and the SciDAC Program of the DOE Office of High Energy Physics under
the U.S. Department of Energy under contract No.\ DE-AC02-05CH11231 to
LBNL and by a DOE/Office of Nuclear Physics grant Nos.\
DE-FG02-06ER41448 and DE-FG02-87ER40317 to Stony Brook.  \\
